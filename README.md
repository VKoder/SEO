## Search Engine

> A search engine is a system used to search for information on the internet. Examples include Google, Bing, and Yahoo.

## SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

> SEO is the process of optimizing web pages to improve their visibility and ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs). This optimization helps attract more organic (unpaid) traffic to websites.

## Benefits of SEO

> SEO makes our lives easier by providing relevant and high-quality search results, saving us the hassle of remembering specific URLs or searching through irrelevant information.

## How SEO Works

> Search engines use crawlers (also known as spiders or bots) to discover and index web pages across the internet. These crawlers collect information about the content of web pages, which is then stored in the search engine's database. The indexer component of a search engine analyzes this content and organizes it into an index, which is used to quickly retrieve relevant information in response to user queries. Search engines use complex algorithms to determine the relevance and ranking of web pages for specific search queries, considering factors such as keywords, content quality, user experience, backlinks, and more.

## White Hat SEO

> White hat SEO involves optimizing your website following search engine guidelines and best practices. It focuses on providing value to users through high-quality content, good keyword research, proper HTML optimization, and ethical link building. White hat techniques aim for long-term sustainability and are less likely to incur penalties from search engines.
